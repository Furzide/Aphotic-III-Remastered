# Aphotic-III-Remastered
### This is a remaster of one of my favourite packs. Additions and Modifications include but are not limited to:
- Modernised Textures.
- Improved Consistency across textures, they now match resolutions a lot better.
- Overhauled Custom skies - There Are 2 skies to choose from if you use a timechanger mod.
- More Custom Sounds.
- Bug Fixes.
- Modern Items and blocks are accounted for, and match the overall theme of the pack.
- Should be compatible with 1.7 - 1.8 all the way to latest versions with minimal input needed.
